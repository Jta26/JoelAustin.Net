            "This project is a full-stack system I am in the process of creating for my undergraduate Capstone Project. It uses Python to parse PDF menus posted on the campus <a href='https://metzupb.com/koa.html' target='_blank'>dining hall website</a>. The Menus are parsed using Pandas, and are then uploaded to a MySQL database. I designed in the database myself and normalized to prevent repetition of data. After that I developed an Node.JS REST API that reads the database information and presents it a a public endpoint for GET requests at <a href='https://api.joelaustin.net' target='_blank'>Api.JoelAustin.Net</a>.",
            "There are various front-end applications that take advantage of the information from the REST API. One being a social network that surrounds the menus, where users can upload images of the menu items for everyone to see. Another front-end use is delivering the information to Google Home and Amazon Echo with Google Actions and Alexa Skills Respectively.<div>View More:</div><div><a href='https://github.com/Jta26/Menu-Parser' target='_blank'>GitHub Repository</a></div>"
