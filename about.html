            <p>I am an excited, motivated and experienced San Diegan developer, who has the skills required to succeed in the industry. I seek to participate as part of a team to provide services such as, web development, android app creation, and other information systems work. Even though I grew up all my life in San Diego, I am attending the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford for Computer Information Systems and Technology. My primary experience is with object-oriented languages like C# and Java, as well as Lua. I am an experienced web developer with knowledge of both client-side and server-side technologies like HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript/JQuery, Node.js, and ASP.NET. My extra-curricular activities include playing and creating games, developing mobile application systems, being a member of two clubs at my university, and even studying Japanese.</p>

            <p> The Computer Information Systems and Technology program at Pitt Bradford has three concentrations that they offer to students. I am concentrating in Application Software Development. This means that I take classes like Advanced Web Development, Game Programming, and Mobile Application Programming. My coursework in Advanced Web Development included working with Microsoft tools like ASP.NET and C#, utilizing MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server, and working with JSON data. In Game Programming I worked with Unity and C# while using GitHub. I've worked as part of a development team to make games on two occasions, one to create a first person shooter game, and another to develop a 2D platformer. On both I was part of the programming team, but also worked with the small team of artists to make sure that everything meshed well together. With Mobile Application Programming I gained valuable knowledge of Java, as well as build tools like Gradle.
